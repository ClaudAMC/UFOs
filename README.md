# UFOs

## Overview of Project

Dana, a data journalist, has chosen to write about UFO sightings. We built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array and created filters so it would be dynamic and respond to user input. The first filter we included was a date filter however Dana would like to provide a more in depth analysis by allowing multiple filters to be used by users. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to build a dynamic table from data stored in a JavaScript array and provide filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape that allow analysis of the data through user input.

## Results

The Javascript array storing the data can be found in the file below:

[data.js](https://github.com/ClaudAMC/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js)

The Javascript file housing our analysis; where we built the table and filters can be found below:

[app.js](https://github.com/ClaudAMC/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/app.js)

The HTML and CSS file housing the styling can be found in the files bnelow, respectively:
